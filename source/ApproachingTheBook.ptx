  <title>How to approach this book </title>
  <p>
  
 <term role="bold">Please follow the sections of this book in order</term>, you should use the <term role="bold">Next</term> button at the top or bottom of the page to navigate to the later sections. Each section of this book builds on the previous one. Skipping ahead makes the material harder to understand. Please watch the videos carefully. You can enlarge the window to view the code examples clearly. If needed, click the settings icon in the video player and set the quality to 1080p for better clarity.
  </p> 
 

<ul>
  <li>After watching the videos, please carefully answer the questions without using any outside resources, and then use the <term role="bold">Check Me</term> button to check your response for correctness. Keep trying until you complete all tasks correctly. Make sure to read the feedback provided for each response.</li> 
  <li>We are sorry that the <term role="bold">Compare Me</term> button does nothing. Unfortunately, we could not remove it. </li>
  <li>The bar at the bottom of each page indicates the number of activities you have completed for the page. Opening a page counts as one activity.</li>
  
<li>Finally, the <term role="bold">Mark as Completed</term> button is only to help you track which pages you have completed and which you want to review later. We use your responses to the activities to determine whether you have completed the tasks.</li>
