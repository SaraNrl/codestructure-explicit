  <title>How to approach this book </title>
  <p>
  
 <term role="bold">Please follow the sections of this book in order</term>, you should use the <term role="bold">Next</term> button at the top or bottom of the page to move to the later sections. Each section of this book builds on the previous one. Skipping ahead makes the material harder to understand. Please watch the videos carefully. You can enlarge the window to view the code examples clearly. If needed, click the settings icon in the video player and set the quality to 1080p for better clarity.
  </p> 
 
 
<p>
After watching the videos, carefully answer the checkpoint questions and complete all the activities without using any outside resources and then use the <term role="bold">Check Me </term> button to check your response for correctness. Try again until you complete all tasks correctly. 
We are sorry that while <term role="bold">Compare Me </term> button does nothing, we could not remove it.
